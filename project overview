Problem Statement:
Understanding customer purchasing behavior is crucial for businesses to improve marketing strategies and personalize recommendations. However, real-world datasets are often expensive or difficult to obtain. This project aims to generate a synthetic dataset that mimics real-world customer transactions using the Faker library. The goal is to analyze customer spending habits, segment customers based on their spending patterns, and predict future purchases.

Dataset Description (Synthetic Dataset)
The dataset will contain simulated transaction records with the following attributes:

Customer ID – Unique identifier for each customer
Name – Fake customer name
Age – Randomized age (18-70 years)
Gender – Male/Female
Location – Random city
Purchase Category – Electronics, Clothing, Grocery, etc.
Transaction Date – Random date within the last two years
Transaction Amount (₹) – Random amount (₹50 - ₹50,000)
Payment Method – Credit Card, Debit Card, UPI, Cash
Loyalty Score – A score (0-100) representing customer loyalty


Project Objectives:

Data Generation: Use the Faker library to generate a dataset of 50,000+ synthetic transactions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns in customer purchases (e.g., average spending per age group, category-wise sales, seasonal trends).
Customer Segmentation: Use clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN) to group customers based on spending behavior.
Predictive Modeling: Build a machine learning model (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict how much a customer will spend in the next transaction.
Visualization: Use Matplotlib/Seaborn to create insightful charts and dashboards.
